# Fitness App - Final Year Project

This project involves the development of a cross-platform mobile application for fitness tracking, workout planning, and personalized nutrition. The app aims to simplify the fitness journey by combining various features like progress tracking, workout and nutrition plan creation, and a marketplace for fitness influencers to sell their programs.

## Key Features:
- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration system for users.
- **Workout & Nutrition Plans:** Users can create, track, and edit their custom workout and nutrition plans.
- **Progress Tracking:** Log workouts, monitor performance, and track body measurements over time.
- **Influencer Marketplace:** Fitness influencers can sell their training plans directly within the app.
- **Public Plan Sharing:** Users can browse, rate, and share fitness plans with the community.
- **Membership System:** Paid membership provides access to exclusive content and additional programs.
- **Payment Integration:** In-app payments for purchasing plans and membership subscriptions.

## Technologies:
- **Frontend:** React Native for cross-platform mobile app development.
- **Backend:** Go programming language with the Echo framework for building the backend.
- **Database:** SQL-based database for storing user data, plans, and progress.
- **Deployment:** AWS for hosting the backend and mobile application deployment on App Store and Google Play.
- **Security:** JWT authentication, encryption, and best practices for data protection.

## Development Methodology:
- **Agile methodology** for iterative development, with regular testing and feedback.

## Project Goals:
- Develop a fully functional fitness app that allows users to manage their fitness journey, from tracking progress to accessing personalized plans.
- Provide a seamless experience for fitness influencers to monetize their content.
- Learn and apply mobile and web development practices, including database management, security, and payment integration.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
